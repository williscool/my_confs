my vim confs and such so I can get to them easily

The files are kept unhidden (that is without dots in front of their names) to make them easier to open for editing

## FIRST
vim wont find the plugins properly if you dont put them where it can. i.e.
  ln -s ~/repo/folder/name ~/.vim

to use a file: 
  ln -s a/file/in/this/repo/filename ~/proper/place/on/system/.filename

example:
  ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc
